# 2020AntarcticHeatwave_attribution_analogs.py

This is the Jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the research published in *Communications of Earth & Environment*.

This repository is divided in different notebooks that:
  - 0a. Download the ERA5 datasets used in this research
  - 0b. Prepare the ERA5 dataset (mean daily temperatures)
  - 1a. Compute and plot the anomalies and percentiles of the 2020 Heatwave
  - 1b. Compute and plot the past-recent distribution and trends of tempearture in the Antarctic Peninsula
  - 2a. Compute and plot temperature anomalies at different stations
  - 3a. Compute and plot the flow analogs, and the temperature differences between the past and recent periods
  - 3b. Compute and plot the flow analogs, and the temperature differences between the past and recent periods (SAM effect removed)
  - 3c. Compute and plot the flow analogs, and the temperature differences between the past and recent periods (Detrended)
